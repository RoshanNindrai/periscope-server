# Laravel routing configuration for Elastic Beanstalk
# This snippet is included inside EB's existing server block
# EB handles PHP-FPM configuration, we only add Laravel routing rules

# Route all requests through Laravel's index.php
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}

# Block hidden files (.env, .git, etc.)
location ~ /\. {
    deny all;
}
