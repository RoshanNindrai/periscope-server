# Laravel routing (included inside EB's server block)
# Note: Do not set 'root' here - EB's php.conf already sets it
# Document root is configured via .ebextensions/03-document-root.config
# Postdeploy hook ensures symlink points to /public as fallback

# Laravel front controller
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}

# Block hidden files (except .well-known)
location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* {
    deny all;
}
