# Laravel routing for EB
# EB sets root to /var/www/html/public (because document_root: /public)
# So we route all requests to /index.php (not /public/index.php since root is already /public)

location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}

# Block hidden files (except .well-known)
location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* {
    deny all;
}
