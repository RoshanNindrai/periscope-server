# Laravel nginx config for EB AL2023
# This snippet is included inside EB's existing server block
# Note: EB's php.conf already sets 'root', so we don't override it here
# Instead, we rely on EB's root and use absolute paths in SCRIPT_FILENAME if needed

# Laravel front controller
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}

# Block hidden files (except .well-known)
location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* {
    deny all;
}
